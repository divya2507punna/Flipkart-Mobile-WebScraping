- **Ratings** ‚≠ê
- **Memory (RAM/ROM)** üß†
- **Image URLs** üì∏
- **Product Links** üîó

This project showcases the power of web scraping in collecting structured data and storing it in a CSV file for further analysis, comparison, and visualization. If you‚Äôve ever wondered how to extract data from e-commerce platforms programmatically, this project is for you!

## Technologies Used

This project uses a combination of powerful Python libraries to perform the web scraping and data manipulation:

- **Python**: The main programming language used to write the script and handle all logic.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A powerful library used to parse HTML and extract useful data from Flipkart's product listings.
- **Requests**: A simple HTTP library to send requests and get the HTML content of the Flipkart page.
- **Pandas**: For organizing and manipulating the scraped data efficiently.
- **CSV**: For saving and exporting the data into a structured CSV file that‚Äôs ready for further analysis or visual representation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Scraping of Mobile Details**: Scrapes detailed data for Realme mobile phones including names, prices, ratings, memory specifications, images, and more.
- **CSV Export**: Saves all collected data into a CSV file, which can easily be imported into tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or Python for analysis.
- **Customizable Data**: You can adjust the number of items scraped, or target different mobile brands or categories on Flipkart.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or incomplete data, ensuring the script runs smoothly even when some information is unavailable.
- **CSV**: For saving and exporting the data into a structured CSV file that‚Äôs ready for further analysis or visual representation.
